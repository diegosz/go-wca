## Contributing

Bug reports and improving the documentation are welcome. (https://github.com/diegosz/go-wca/issues)

The Windows Core Audio API IAudioSessionNotification was introduced in Windows 7, so that the later than that version of Windows should run this example.
Tested on Windows 10 however.
